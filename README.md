TempTest

A simple program to read the temperature data from the HTS221 sensor on the STM32L475VG dev board.<p>
  
   I used CubeMX to generate an IAR/STM32IDE project and then replaced the generated main.c file with this one.
   Please see the comments in main.c for details on setting up he USART and I2C pins in CubeMX.
